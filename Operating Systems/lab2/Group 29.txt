Documentation                       4/4
Your initial pseudo code algorithm is descriptive. The overall explanation of how the program works shows you have
full understanding of how the code works.

Structure and Clarity of Approach   1.5/2
The code for my_read_proc() is efficient. Your code is well structured and formatted, but could benefit 
from better commenting. More comments could be added on your major structure points such as if statement labels 
and function definitions to explain how your code works.

Testing and Correctness             2/4
Your testing document does not have any output of your program so there is no proof that it does run properly.
According to the lab documentation you were to in your report compare the output of your program to that of the ps 
command to show it correctly reads all the running processes and does not just read random data. You must also 
explain any difference between the output of your program and the ps command as they will not be identical.
