Documentation				4/4
The overall explanation of the problem and how you plan to solve it shows you know how the exploit works and
how the values are set.


Structure and Clarity of Approach 	1/2
Your C byte array has no comments showing which assembly instruction it is executing, which makes the code
unclear to read/debug. You should structure your array like "0x5E, // pop esi". Your nasm code also has no
comments explaining its function. It should be divided into four main blocks of Restore null bytes, Store args
pointers to array, Set up system call and data setup, with comments on what the asm commands do.


Testing			4/4
Your testing methodologies are thorough and you correctly prove your exploit works, demonstrating correct
output.
